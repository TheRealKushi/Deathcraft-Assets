# Reporting Security Issues

The NakedAndAfraid Plugin team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/TheRealKushi/Naked-And-Afraid-Plugin/security/advisories/new) tab.

The team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply, we will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party dependencies (like ProtocolLib) to the person or team maintaining that plugin.

## The NakedAndAfraid Security Notification Process

For context on how we handle security notifications, we will respond via GitHub security advisories and keep you updated on any fixes or patches as quickly as possible.
